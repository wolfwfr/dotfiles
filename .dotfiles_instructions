These dotfiles are managed through a bare git repository that separates the
git worktree from the .git directory root.

This method was inspired by Marcel Krcah (https://marcel.is/managing-dotfiles-with-git-bare-repo/).

Here follow instructions for the set-up.

## Creating a new repository:

1. create & navigate to a directory that'll host your dotfiles' .git directory
   (e.g. ~/dotfiles)
2. run `git init --bare`
3. configure an alias in your shell for interacting with this git repository,
   e.g. `alias dot="/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME"`
4. create (if not planning to pull one from remote repository) a .gitignore file
   at $HOME that ignores everything (`/*`) except (`!<path-to-my-files>`) the
   dotfiles.

## Pulling dotfiles on fresh install:

1. follow previous steps
2. run `git clone <my-remote-repo>`
3. move all the directories or files to their intended locations.
4. remove the temporary directory with your git clone.
5. navigate to the dotfiles .git directory root.
6. set up the git remote with `git remote add origin <my-remote-git-repo>`
